# CafÃ© App in Reace Native CLI â˜•
This was to my school laboratory where I have to build my first react-native cli. It was require to not call any wireframes instead build own buttons and other components.
Today 2022 April react native cli has launched 0.68 version and updated Gradle. So there is a chance that it can crash. Contant me if you have got problem :) 

Please do not steal the code.
